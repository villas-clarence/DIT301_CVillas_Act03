## Short Reflection
- **Design choices (colors, fonts, layout)**: I used a modern purple-accent palette with supportive pink/coral accents to create clear visual hierarchy and brand consistency. Typography emphasizes readability: larger, bold display for the name and comfortable 16sp for body copy. The layout is based on `ConstraintLayout` inside elevated `CardView`s to create depth, keep content centered, and scale well across screen sizes/orientations.
- **User-friendly and accessible**: Elements follow Material spacing; tap targets meet 48dp minimum. Text uses `sp` units and high-contrast colors. Images include `contentDescription`. The structure is semantic and works in both portrait and landscape via dedicated resources, keeping primary actions and information above the fold.
- **Improvements for a real app**: Add real profile editing with validation and image cropping, persist data locally and via backend sync, provide dark mode, add animation/motion for affordances, expand accessibility (TalkBack hints, contrast audit), and include tests and performance optimizations (image compression, placeholders).
