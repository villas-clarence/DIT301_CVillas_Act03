What design choices did you make (colors, fonts, layout)?
In designing the profile screen, I opted for a minimalist and professional style. I used a light background paired with dark text to enhance readability and visual comfort. The sans-serif font was selected for its clean and modern appearance. I arranged the elements logically, placing the profile picture at the top center, followed by the user’s name, a brief bio, and an edit button beneath. This layout creates a clear visual hierarchy and ensures a well-balanced design.

How did you ensure the screen is user-friendly and accessible?
To make the interface user-friendly and accessible, I maintained high contrast between text and background, used consistent margins and spacing, and applied readable text sizes. 
I followed the CRAP design principles—Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity—to achieve a coherent and organized layout. Additionally, I verified the design’s adaptability by testing it in both portrait and landscape orientations to ensure it remains functional and visually consistent across various devices.

What would you improve if this were a real app?
If this project were developed into a real application, I would enhance the Edit button with interactive functionality, allowing users to modify their profile information. 
I would also consider adding features such as profile customization, image upload capabilities, and user settings for personalization. Furthermore, I would integrate accessibility features such as adjustable text sizes, screen reader compatibility, and color-blind-friendly themes to ensure inclusivity for all users.
